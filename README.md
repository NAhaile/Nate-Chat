# Nate-Chat
I thought it would be a fun idea to make a chatbox that would essentially hold a conversation as I would if it were face to face.

Update 1/24/20; I begun to start coding, but as I began to write the code on Eclipse, I quickly found that there are many different variations of ChatBox's so I am trying to narrow it down to one right now

Update 1/25/20; Haven't had a lot of time to work on The ChatBox, but I will start very soon, I am getting my academics squared away first.
